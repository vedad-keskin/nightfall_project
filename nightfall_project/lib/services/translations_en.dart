  'rules_impostor_content':
      '1. Setup:\n'
      'Pass the device to each player so everyone can see their role and/or word.\n\n'
      '2. Roles:\n'
      'One player is the IMPOSTOR.\n'
      'The rest are INNOCENTS.\n\n'
      '3. Secret Word:\n'
      'INNOCENTS see the secret word.\n'
      'The IMPOSTOR only sees the category and, if enabled, a hint.\n'
      'Hints are recommended for groups of 5 or fewer players. For larger groups, playing without hints is usually more fun.\n\n'
      '4. Taking Turns:\n'
      'Players take turns in a circle, starting from the player chosen first by the game.\n'
      'On your turn, say ONE word related to the secret word.\n'
      'Words that are part of the secret word are usually not allowed unless agreed on beforehand.\n'
      'If you don\'t know a word, you may Google it. The IMPOSTOR can also Google to mislead others.\n'
      'Repeating words is not allowed.\n\n'
      '5. Voting:\n'
      'After the 2nd or 3rd round, discuss and vote on who the IMPOSTOR is.\n'
      'Voting can happen earlier if INNOCENTS are confident or if the IMPOSTOR gives themselves away.\n\n'
      '6. Winning the Game:\n'
      'If the IMPOSTOR is caught, the INNOCENTS win.\n'
      'If an INNOCENT is voted out, the IMPOSTOR wins and earns a point.\n'
      'Points are tracked on the Leaderboard.\n\n'
      '7. Have Fun!\n'
      'Enjoy the game, be sneaky if you\'re the IMPOSTOR, and try to catch the IMPOSTOR if you\'re INNOCENT. Good luck!',
  'rules_werewolves_title': 'HOW TO PLAY: WEREWOLVES',
  'rules_werewolves_content':
      '1. Role Distribution:\n'
      'Pass the device to each player individually so they can view their role in secret.\n'
      'Players must confirm they have seen and understood their role before passing the device to the next player.\n\n'
      '2. Setup:\n'
      'One player needs to be the Narrator. The Narrator does not participate as a character and cannot be killed or voted out.\n'
      'The Narrator controls the flow of the game and follows instructions provided by the app.\n'
      'Players are randomly assigned roles belonging to one of the main alliances: THE VILLAGE or THE WEREWOLVES.\n'
      'Some players may receive unique special roles with additional abilities.\n\n'
      '3. Alliances and Goals:\n'
      'THE VILLAGE: Wins if all Werewolves are eliminated.\n'
      'THE WEREWOLVES: Win if they reach a point where the number of Werewolves is equal to or greater than the number of remaining Villagers.\n'
      'THE SPECIALS: They have their own special winning conditions.\n\n'
      '4. The Night Phase:\n'
      'All players close their eyes and remain silent.\n'
      'The Narrator wakes specific roles one by one, following the order shown in the app.\n'
      'When a role is awake, players use silent gestures only. To execute their ability, they point their finger at the chosen player.\n'
      'The Narrator acknowledges the choice and instructs the role to return to sleep.\n'
      'No speaking, sounds, or discussion are allowed during the Night Phase.\n\n'
      '5. The Day Phase:\n'
      'The Narrator announces the outcome of the Night (who was killed, if anyone).\n'
      'Eliminated players must remain silent for the rest of the game and may not vote.\n'
      'Discussion: All surviving players may freely discuss and accuse others.\n'
      'A discussion timer may be set when creating the game. The timer serves only as a reminder for the Narrator to move the game forward.\n'
      'Voting: Players may vote to eliminate a suspect by pointing at them.\n'
      'A player is hanged and eliminated only if they receive more than half of the votes from all living players.\n'
      'Voting may be skipped.\n'
      'If no player receives a strict majority, or in case of a tie, no player is eliminated.\n\n'
      '6. Character Abilities:\n'
      'WEREWOLF: Awakens at night with other Werewolves and collectively chooses one victim to kill.\n'
      'VILLAGER: Has no special ability. Relies on discussion, logic, and voting.\n'
      'VAMPIRE: Awakens with the Werewolves but appears as a Villager when inspected.\n'
      'DOCTOR: Chooses one player each night to protect from being killed.\n'
      'May protect themselves.\n'
      'Cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\n'
      'GUARD: Inspects one player each night.\n'
      'The Narrator privately shows the inspection result on their device to the Guard.\n'
      'Inspection Result:\n'
      'VILLAGER – All types of Villagers, Vampires, and Jesters.\n'
      'WEREWOLF – Werewolves, Drunks, and the Avenging Twin.\n\n'
      'PLAGUE DOCTOR: Can protect one player at night, but there is a small chance the target dies instead.\n'
      'May protect themselves.\n'
      'Cannot protect the same player on two consecutive nights.\n'
      'TWINS: If one Twin is hanged during the Day Phase, the other immediately becomes a Werewolf.\n'
      'If one Twin is killed during the Night Phase, the other remains a Villager.\n'
      'AVENGING TWIN: If their Twin dies, they transform into an Avenging Twin.\n'
      'From the next night onward, they awaken and act with the Werewolves.\n'
      'JESTER: Wins instantly and alone if eliminated by Village vote during the Day Phase.\n'
      'DRUNK: Has no special ability and behaves as a normal Villager.\n'
      'When inspected by the Guard, the Drunk is suspicious and appears as a Werewolf.\n'
      'KNIGHT: A Villager with two lives, one protected by armor.\n'
      'First life (Armor): Cannot be healed by the Doctor or Plague Doctor.\n'
      'The armor can be destroyed by a Werewolf attack or a Plague Doctor accidental kill.\n'
      'If both attacks happen on the same night, the Knight dies immediately.\n'
      'Second life: Can be killed by Werewolves or a Plague Doctor accidental kill.\n'
      'The second life can be saved by either the Doctor or the Plague Doctor.\n'
      'PUPPET MASTER: Starts the game as a normal Villager.\n'
      'When the first hanging of the game occurs, the Puppet Master transforms into the role of the hanged player.\n'
      'The hanged player is eliminated normally.\n'
      'If the Puppet Master is killed, nothing special happens.\n'
      'If the Jester is hanged, the Jester wins immediately and no Puppet Master transformation occurs.\n'
      'If the Gambler is hanged, the Puppet Master inherits the bet the Gambler made at the start of the game.\n'
      'The Puppet Master does not know what the Gambler bet on.\n'
      'If the bet is correct, both the Gambler and the Puppet Master receive the win.\n'
      'EXECUTIONER: A vengeful villager. If hanged by the village, he can take one player with him to the grave.\n'
      'INFECTED: A villager carrying a hidden sickness. If a healer treats them successfully, the healer gets infected and dies.\n'
      'GAMBLER: A cunning risk-taker who bets on fate.\n'
      'On the first night only, the Gambler is woken first and secretly chooses which alliance they believe will win.\n'
      'After placing their bet, they behave as a normal Villager for the rest of the game with no special powers.\n'
      'If the Gambler\'s chosen alliance wins, they earn bonus points: +1 for Village, +2 for Werewolves, +3 for Specials (Jester).\n'
      'The Gambler appears as a Villager when inspected by the Guard.\n\n'
      '7. Scoring:\n'
      'Points are awarded to members of the winning alliance at the end of the game.\n'
      'Different roles grant different amounts of points depending on their difficulty.\n'
      'Full point distributions can be found in the Roles section of the game.\n'
      'Special roles do not belong to an alliance and instead have their own winning conditions.\n'
      'Enjoy the mystery and deception. Good luck!\n\n',

  'rules_impostor_content':
      '1. Pass the device to each player so everyone can see their role and/or word.\n\n'
      '2. Roles:\n'
      '- One player is the IMPOSTOR.\n'
      '- The rest are INNOCENTS.\n\n'
      '3. Secret Word:\n'
      '- INNOCENTS see the secret word.\n'
      '- The IMPOSTOR only sees the category and, if enabled, a hint.\n'
      '- Hints are recommended for groups of 5 or fewer players. For larger groups, playing without hints is usually more fun.\n\n'
      '4. Taking Turns:\n'
      '- Players take turns in a circle, starting from the player chosen first by the game.\n'
      '- On your turn, say ONE word related to the secret word.\n'
      '- Words that are part of the secret word are usually not allowed unless agreed on beforehand.\n'
      '- If you don\'t know a word, you may Google it. The IMPOSTOR can also Google to mislead others.\n'
      '- Repeating words is not allowed.\n\n'
      '5. Voting:\n'
      '- After the 2nd or 3rd round, discuss and vote on who the IMPOSTOR is.\n'
      '- Voting can happen earlier if INNOCENTS are confident or if the IMPOSTOR gives themselves away.\n\n'
      '6. Winning the Game:\n'
      '- If the IMPOSTOR is caught, the INNOCENTS win.\n'
      '- If an INNOCENT is voted out, the IMPOSTOR wins and earns a point.\n'
      '- Points are tracked on the Leaderboard.\n\n'
      '7. Have Fun!\n'
      'Enjoy the game, be sneaky if you\'re the IMPOSTOR, and try to catch the IMPOSTOR if you\'re INNOCENT. Good luck!',
  'rules_werewolves_title': 'HOW TO PLAY: WEREWOLVES',
  'rules_werewolves_content':
      '1. Pass the device to each player so everyone can see their role.\n\n'
      '2. Setup:\n'
      '- The game requires a Narrator who manages the transitions and reads instructions from the app.\n'
      '- Players are divided into two main alliances: THE VILLAGE and THE WEREWOLVES.\n'
      '- There may also be unique special roles.\n\n'
      '3. Alliances and Goals:\n'
      '- VILLAGE: Goal is to find and eliminate all werewolves. They win if all werewolves are dead.\n'
      '- WEREWOLVES: Goal is to outnumber the villagers. They win if they achieve a 1:1 or better ratio with villagers.\n'
      '- JESTER (Neutral): Wins ONLY if they are voted out by the village during the Day Phase.\n\n'
      '4. The Night Phase:\n'
      '- Everyone closes their eyes.\n'
      '- The Narrator calls specific roles to wake up and perform their actions via the app (e.g., werewolves choosing a victim, doctor saving someone).\n\n'
      '5. The Day Phase:\n'
      '- The Narrator announces who was killed during the Night (if anyone).\n'
      '- Dead players must remain silent and cannot vote.\n'
      '- Discussion: Surviving players discuss who they think the werewolves are.\n'
      '- A timer for the duration of the day can be set when creating the game.\n'
      '  It does not force the vote or skip it; it only serves as a reminder for the Narrator\n'
      '  that discussion time is over and that he should prompt players to vote or skip the voting.\n'
      '- Voting: Players can vote to hang a suspect. The player with the most votes is eliminated.\n'
      '- The Village is not required to hang a player each day.\n'
      '- In case of a tie, no one is hanged.\n\n'
      '6. Character Abilities:\n'
      '- WEREWOLF: Chooses a victim each night together with other Werewolves.\n'
      '- VILLAGER: Has no special ability; relies on discussion and voting.\n'
      '- VAMPIRE: Awakens with the Werewolves but appears as a Villager when inspected.\n'
      '- DOCTOR: Can protect one player each night from being killed. May protect himself, but cannot protect the same person two nights in a row.\n'
      '- GUARD: Can inspect one player each night. The Narrator gives a hand sign:\n'
      '  V = Villager, W = Werewolf.\n'
      '  Jesters and Vampires receive the V sign. Only Werewolves and the Avenging Twin receive the W sign.\n'
      '- PLAGUE DOCTOR: Can protect a player, but there is a small chance the target dies instead.\n'
      '- TWINS: If one Twin is hanged, the other becomes a Werewolf.\n'
      '  If one Twin is killed at night, the other remains a Villager.\n'
      '- AVENGING TWIN: If their Twin dies, they become an Avenging Twin and wake up with the Werewolves from the next night forward.\n'
      '- JESTER: Wins immediately only if hanged by the Village.\n\n'
      '7. Scoring:\n'
      '- Points are awarded to members of the winning alliance at the end of the game.\n'
      '- Different roles grant different amounts of points depending on their difficulty.\n\n'
